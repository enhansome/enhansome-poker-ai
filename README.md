# Awesome Poker AI with stars

> A curated list of AI poker research, open-source tools, solvers, and educational resources. Updated for 2026.

Poker is one of the most challenging domains for AI due to imperfect information, hidden cards, bluffing, and multi-player dynamics. This list covers the key research breakthroughs, open-source projects, and tools that have shaped the field.

## Research Papers

### Landmark Papers

## LLMs vs Poker: The 2025-2026 Wave

The explosion of general-purpose LLMs created massive public interest in whether ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok could play poker. Short answer: they can't — not at a competitive level. But the experiments were fascinating.

### Events

* **[Kaggle AI Poker Showdown](https://www.kaggle.com/game-arena)** (February 2026) — Google DeepMind and Kaggle organized the first major LLM-vs-LLM poker exhibition. Ten flagship models (GPT-5.2, GPT-o3, GPT-5 mini, Grok-4, Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning, Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 3 Flash, Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-V3.2) played 900,000+ hands of heads-up NLHE. GPT-5.2 was the most profitable overall; o3 won the exhibition bracket. All models played without solvers or CFR — pure text-pattern decisions. Doug Polk, Nick Schulman, and Liv Boeree provided commentary.

* **[PokerBattle.ai](https://pokerbattle.ai/about)** (October-November 2025) — Five-day LLM cash game marathon organized by Max Pavlov. Nine models played Texas Hold'em around the clock. OpenAI o3 won with $36,691 profit over 3,799 hands. Meta LLAMA 4 performed worst, busting its entire $100K bankroll. Demonstrated the same fundamental LLM weaknesses: excessive aggression, poor bluffing comprehension, inability to fold.

### Key Takeaways

The consensus from Kaggle, PokerBattle.ai, and professional analysis is clear:

1. **LLMs do not understand poker mathematics.** They generate plausible-sounding text about poker but cannot reliably calculate equity, pot odds, or EV.
2. **LLMs hallucinate hand strength.** They confuse suits, misread boards, and misidentify winning hands — even when they answer correctly in isolation.
3. **LLMs cannot adapt to opponents.** No cross-hand memory, no range construction, no exploitative adjustments.
4. **Specialized poker AI (CFR-based) solved this years ago.** Libratus (2017) and Pluribus (2019) achieved superhuman play through game theory, not language modeling. LLMs represent a step backward for poker AI, not forward.

SpinGPT is the notable exception — but it requires solver-generated training data and works only in a severely constrained format (3-player Spin & Go with short stacks).
